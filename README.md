# Neural Networks Fusion

This project is a Final Project Degree created by Pedro Antonio Pe√±a Puente, a robotics engineer from the University of Malaga. Here I implement a neural networks fusion algorithm with ROS2 where we are able to read RGB images with thermical images by ROS2 topics, process them with the neural networks I trained, create a fusion response and send it by another ROS2 topic. Finally, I created an application with opencv where we can visualize the results. The base project I used to implement YOLOv8 in ROS2 comes from the repository https://github.com/mgonzs13/yolov8_ros .
